Overview
========

This is (hopefully) to become the central documentation store for the IMAC Judge app.    One documentation site that describes hardware, software, design and development.

A user guide can be part of this but should be a separate document as it will be passed to the end users for use and they probably don't want to hear about things like Spring Boot, KiCad and Materialize ;-).
